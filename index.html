    <h2>1869</h2>
    <p>Just after midnight on September 27, 1869, Ellis County Sheriff Wild Bill Hickok and his deputy respond to a
      report that a local ruffian named Samuel Strawhun and several drunken buddies were tearing up John Bitters Beer
      Saloon in Hays City, Kansas. When Hickok arrived and ordered the men to stop, Strawhun turned to attack him, and
      Hickok shot him in the head. Strawhun died instantly, as did the riot.
      Such were Wild Bill's less-than-restrained law enforcement methods. Famous for his skill with a pistol and
      steely-calm under fire, James Butler Hickok initially seemed to be the ideal man for the sheriff of Ellis County,
      Kansas.
      The good citizens of Hays City, the county seat, were tired of the wild brawls and destructiveness of the
      hard-drinking buffalo hunters and soldiers who took over their town every night. They hoped the famous “Wild Bill”
      could restore peace and order, and in the late summer of 1869, elected him as interim county sheriff.
      Tall, athletic and sporting shoulder-length hair and a sweeping mustache, Hickok cut an impressive figure, and his
      reputation as a deadly shot with either hand was often all it took to keep many potential lawbreakers on the
      straight and narrow. As one visiting cowboy later recalled, Hickok would stand “with his back to the wall, looking
      at everything and everybody under his eyebrows—just like a mad old bull.” But when Hickok applied more aggressive
      methods of enforcing the peace, some Hays City citizens wondered if their new cure wasn't worse than the disease.
      Shortly after becoming sheriff, Hickok shot a belligerent soldier who resisted arrest, and the man died the next
      day. A few weeks later Hickok killed Strawhun. While his brutal ways were indisputably effective, many Hays City
      citizens were less than impressed that after only five weeks in office he had already found it necessary to kill
      two men in the name of preserving peace.
      During the regular November election later that year, the people expressed their displeasure, and Hickok lost to
      his deputy, 144-89. Though Wild Bill Hickok would later go on to hold other law enforcement positions in the West,
      his first attempt at being a sheriff had lasted only three months.

    <h2>1938</h2>
    <p>On September 27, 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt wrote to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler regarding the threat
      of war in Europe. The German chancellor had been threatening to invade the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia and, in
      the letter, his second to Hitler in as many days, Roosevelt reiterated the need to find a peaceful resolution to
      the issue.
      The previous day, FDR had written to Hitler with an appeal to negotiate with Czechoslovakia regarding Germany's
      desire for the natural and industrial resources of the Sudetenland rather than resort to force. Hitler responded
      that Germany was entitled to the area because of the “shameful” way in which the Treaty of Versailles, which had
      ended World War I, had made Germany a “pariah” in the community of nations. The treaty had given the Sudetenland,
      a territory that was believed by Hitler and many of his supporters to be inherently German, to the state of
      Czechoslovakia. Therefore, Hitler reasoned, German invasion of the Sudetenland was justified, as annexation by
      Germany would simply mean returning the area to its cultural and historical roots. Hitler assured Roosevelt that
      he also desired to avoid another large-scale war in Europe.
      In his letter of September 27, Roosevelt expressed relief at Hitler's assurances but re-emphasized his desire that
      “negotiations [between Germany and Czechoslovakia] be continued until a peaceful settlement is found.” FDR also
      suggested that a conference of all nations concerned with the current conflict be convened as soon as possible. He
      appealed to Hitler's ego, saying “should you agree to a solution in this peaceful manner I am convinced that
      hundreds of millions throughout the world would recognize your action as an outstanding historic service to all
      humanity.” FDR then assured Hitler that the U.S. would remain neutral regarding European politics, but that
      America recognized a responsibility to be involved “as part of a world of neighbors.”
      In the end, Hitler ignored the international community's pleas for a peaceful solution and invaded Czechoslovakia
      in March 1939. The invasion was just the first in Hitler's quest to control Europe and create a “Third Reich” of
      German geopolitical supremacy.
